## This is an Image Classification project which is a kind of Computer Vision variety. 
## The goal is to identify correctly digits from the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset which includes in tens of thousands of handwritten images.
## There are from 0 to 9 digits which are in .png format as images in the dataset which means there are 10 classes to predict.
## Training set and testing set were separete. They used separately for training and evaluating the model. 
## The rate of per number, for the training set and the testing set, were changing. However they were not meaningful differances. Therefore, we can say the rate of the training set approximatelly 85% and testing set is 15%.
## In this project, used CNN architecture which is a Deep Learning Architecture to process and make predictions from images.
## Model performance: The accuracy of the model is 99.52% which means the model has high performance for predicting class of the digits.
